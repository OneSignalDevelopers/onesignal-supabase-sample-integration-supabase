# OneSignal Supabase Edge Function Integration Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates sending push notifications using [Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) hosted on Supabase. You can use function implemented in this sample as a reference for using OneSignal in your Supabase deployment.

## üö¶ Getting started

This project assumes that you already have a few things setup
* OneSignal app with push notifications configured. If you don't have one configured, follow these [instructions to create your first app](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/apps-organizations#create-an-app).
* Mobile app with OneSignal integrated. If you don't have OneSignal integrated in your app, then follow the steps for [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/android-sdk-setup) or [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup) to get your app setup to receive notifications from OneSignal.
* Supabase CLI installed on your system. If you don't have the CLI installed on your system, head to the [Supabase CLI docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli#installation) for instructions to get started.
